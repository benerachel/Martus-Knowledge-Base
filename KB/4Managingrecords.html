                                    <h3>Default views and folders</h3>
                                    <p>Martus automatically includes three permanent views: All, Saved, and Received. 
                                    (These default labels are different from some earlier versions of Martus. If you upgrade from a version earlier than Martus 5.0, your old labels will automatically be migrated to this new folder structure, so your records will not be lost.)</p>
                                    <p><b>All</b></p>
                                        <p>All records on your local machine will be listed under the All view.</p>
                                    <p><b>Saved</b></p>
                                        <p>The Saved view contains all records that you have saved, whether they are versioned or not or shared with contacts, and whether they have been sent to the server or not.</p>
                                    <p><b>Received</b></p>
                                        <p>This view contains records you’ve received from another Martus user. These records are included in searches and you can copy or move them to different folders. </p>
                                    <p>An <b>Imported Records</b> folder will be created if you load any records into Martus using the Import Record icon in the Martus sidebar.</p>
                                    <h3>Create New Folders</h3>
                                    <p>Create additional folders to categorize records according to your interests or current projects.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                        <li>Select the Add icon from the Martus sidebar.</li>
                                        <li>Input a name for the new folder.</li>
                                        <li>Select Create.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>Rename Folders</h3>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                        <li>Double-click the folder you would like to rename.</li>
                                        <li>Input a new name for the folder.</li>
                                        <li>Select Rename.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Note: You cannot use punctuation in a folder name, but you can include spaces. You can also use characters from non-Latin alphabets, such as Arabic or Russian.</p>
                                    <p>You can’t rename permanent views such as All, Saved, and Received.</p>
                                    <p>You can rename the Imported Records folder, however Martus will create a new Imported Records folder the next time you import data into Martus.</p>
                                    <h3>Delete Folders</h3>
                                    <p>Deleting a folder removes the folder and moves all records under that label to the Trash.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                        <li>Select the folder you would like to remove.</li>
                                        <li>Select the Delete icon from the Martus sidebar.</li>
                                        <li>Read the informational text.</li>
                                        <li>Select Delete to confirm deletion.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>Move records</h3>
                                    <ol class="list">                                   
                                        <li>Select the records that you would like to move.</li>
                                        <li>Select the Move icon ( ) in the taskbar below the main list pane.</li>
                                        <li>Select the folder under which you would like the record to be moved.</li>
                                        <li>Uncheck Remove from… to keep the record(s) listed under multiple folders.</li>
                                        <p>Note: The multiple listings will still be considered one record.</p>
                                        <li>Select Move.
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Note: You may also create a new folder in which to save your search results using the Add icon in the Martus sidebar and then following the above directions after performing a search.</p>
                                    <h3>Copy a record</h3>
                                    <p>Unlike moving a record, copying a record creates a new record based on the original. The new record must be renamed to differentiate it from the original.</p>
                                        <ol class="list">
                                        <li>Select the record that you would like to make a copy.</li>
                                        <p>Note: Only one record can be copied at a time.</p>
                                        <li>Select the Copy icon ( ) in the taskbar below the main list pane.</li>
                                        <li>Enter a new name for the copy of the record.</li>
                                        <li>Uncheck Remove from Existing? to keep the record(s) under multiple folders.</li>
                                        <li>Select Copy.</li>
                                        </ol>

                                     <h3>Delete</h3>
                                     <p>Deleting a record from a folder does not delete the record from your local device or the server. The record moves to the Trash, located in the Martus sidebar where it can still be viewed or moved, but not edited.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                    <li>Select the record you would like to delete.</li>
                                    <li>Select the Delete icon in the taskbar below the main list pane.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>Delete Records from your Hard Drive</h3>
                                    <p>Once you delete a record from your hard drive, you cannot retrieve it unless it is stored on the server.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                    <li>Select the Trash icon from the Martus sidebar.</li>
                                    <li>Review the records listed in the Trash to be sure you do not accidentally delete important records.</li>
                                    <li>Select Empty Trash.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>You do not need to do anything further to ensure that deleted records are removed from your hard drive. Unlike most computer data, Martus records are encrypted files on your hard drive—including your own records, records created by other people, and deleted records. Therefore, unless someone gains access to your Martus account, they cannot read the records you store in your folders or the records you’ve deleted. </p>
                                    <h3>Delete Records from the Server</h3>
                                    <p>Once you delete a record from the server, you cannot retrieve it unless you have a local or exported copy.</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                    <li>Select the Sync Manager icon from the Martus sidebar.</li>
                                    <li>Select the desired record.</li>
                                    <li>Select Delete from Server.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Note: If the Delete from Server option is not available for the record you have selected, the record has either not been uploaded to the server or is a record shared with you by another Martus account. Shared records cannot be deleted from the server by anyone but their original author.</p>

                                <p>Martus allows you to export encrypted (*.mba) and unencrypted (*.xml) record files which can then be imported back into Martus.</p>

                                <p>When exporting unencrypted records, all information will be saved as plain text and anyone who gets a copy of the file will be able to read its contents. These files can be used to import record data back into Martus or into another application.</p>

                                    <p>Using Tor will make it harder to track the route your record takes to the Martus server, and may allow you to reach the Martus server if it is blocked from your current location, but will also make sending and receiving records slower. For more information about Tor, go to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a> or see <a href="#">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>
