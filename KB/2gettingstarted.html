                                                <li>See what version of Java you are currently running by typing:
                                                                <p>java -version</p>
                                                <p>Java must be installed and in your PATH for this to work.</p>
                                                <p>You must have (or install) either Oracle’s official Java version 1.8.0_40 (sometimes called Java8). If possible, we recommend using the standard software installation tools from your operating system, such as yum/rpm or apt/deb. If you want to run Oracle's JRE but it is not available that way, you can download it directly from http://java.com/<p>
                                                <p>Note: To run Martus, you only need to install the current version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE), not the larger Java Developer’s Kit (JDK).</p>

                                                </li>
                                                <li>Choose and create a directory to hold the Martus program files (i.e. a “Martus program directory”). This may be the same as the Martus data directory (~/.Martus/) or may be different. For example, you might install the Martus application within your Desktop directory, making it easy to find. Separating the program from the data may increase security, but will make it harder to entirely erase Martus if you needed to do so. You would make the directory by typing the following at the prompt in the location you choose:
                                                <p>mkdir -p < Martus Program Directory></p>
                                                <p>For example, if you wanted to install the Martus 4.0 into its data directory, you would type:
                                                <p>mkdir -p ~/.Martus</p>
                                                </li>

                                                    <li>Copy martus.jar from the root directory on the installation CD into the Martus program directory.</li>
                                                    <li>Copy the LibExt directory from the CD into Martus program directory, and rename it as ThirdParty.</li>
                                                    <li>If desired you can also copy the Documents directory which contains user documentation including the README files that contain a list of changes between versions of Martus.</li>
                                                    <li>Change to the directory that contains the actual application, by typing the following:
                                                        <p>cd < Martus Program Directory></p>
                                                    <p>For example, if you installed Martus into its data directory, you would type:</p>
                                                        <p>cd ~/.Martus</p></li></ol>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>If installing from the zip file:
                                                <p>Change to the directory you created to install Martus into, extract the zip file contents there, and change to the directory that contains the actual application, by typing the following:</p>
                                                <p>cd < Martus Program Directory></p>
                                                <p>unzip < Path to Zip File></p>
                                                <p>cd < Martus Version Directory></p>
                                                <p>For example, if you wanted to install the Martus 4.5 into its data directory, and the zip file was in ~/Downloads and named MartusClient- 4.5.zip, you would type:</p>
                                                        <p>cd ~/.Martus</p>
                                                        <p>unzip ~/Downloads/MartusClient- 4.5.zip</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Test the installation by running Martus, by typing:
                                                        <p>java -jar `pwd`/martus.jar </p>
                                                <p>(You do not have to type out the name of the directory you are in, since `pwd` does that for you. )</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>You can create a shortcut script as follows:
                                                        <p>echo java -jar martus.jar >martus</p>
                                                        <p>chmod +x martus</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>You can copy this script elsewhere, or you can set up a launcher or shortcut to it, to make it easy to start Martus.</li>

                                            <li>Keywords - Type words that are synonyms for acts you described in the record, other related words, and alternative location names, if appropriate. This is especially helpful for searching.</li>
                                            <li>Date of Event - Enter the date of the event you’re reporting. Leave the date as Unknown if you are uncertain when the event occurred.</li>

                                    <p>Selecting Save once you have created a record allows you modify the original record at a later time without creating a new version of that record. Once you edit and Save a record, you cannot restore the previous version of the record.</p>

                                    <p>Versioning a record allows you to update information in the record but keep older versions intact, and prevents the earlier versions of the record from being edited. Versions of each record are connected, creating a new copy does not increase the total number of records (e.g., in searches).</p>
                                    <ol class="list">
                                    <li>Choose Create new record ( ) or Edit ( ) a record and input data.</li>

                                    <p>Alternately, you can create a copy of a record to use as a starting point for a new record.</p>
                                    <h3>View earlier versions of a record</h3>
                                    <p>You can view any version of a record on your computer. However, you can only make changes to a new version.</p>

                                    <li>Select the record version you would like to view from the list. A separate window will display the past record version.</li>

                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Note: If you are allowed to retrieve records from a Contact and you didn’t have access to an earlier version of a Contact’s record, Martus will list the earlier version in the record details, but it won’t retrieve that version of the record to your computer.</p>
                                    <h3>Permanently save a record</h3>
                                    <p>To ensure that a record is never permanently deleted from the server, even if it is deleted from your local device, Martus offers the option to - individually or as a default - never delete records from your configured backup server.</p>
                                    <h3>Permanently Save to the Server by Default</h3>

                                    <p>Tip: Consider changing the title of the modified version of the record in a way that makes it clear that it contains corrected or additional information. For example, if the original versioned record is titled “Political leaders jailed,” you might title the modified version “Political leaders jailed – updated.” </p>

                                    <p>To discard the information you’ve entered in a record, click Cancel. Martus alerts you that you’ll be deleting any unsaved information in the record, since it was last saved. Click Yes to discard the unsaved information permanently. (If you click Cancel when you’re modifying a record, the record will revert to the state it was in when you opened it.)</p>
