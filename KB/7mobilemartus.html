                                    <p>Mobile Martus is a secure, Android-based mobile documentation application built on Benetech’s Martus technology, which allows users anywhere in the world to securely gather and organize information about human rights violations.</p>
                                    <p> Mobile Martus application allows users to send crucial data from the field—text, photographs, audio and video—to the Martus network of secure servers. The data is automatically encrypted on the mobile device, and when being sent to the server, so it is protected in case the device is lost, stolen or confiscated. A user—or someone they designate—can later retrieve their data, and can search, analyze and report on the information, using the Martus client software on their computer.</p>

                                    <p>Users can choose the “Martus” icon to send a file to Martus (as a record attachment) via the “Send To” (or “Share”) option in many third party apps.  For example, users can take a photo or video or record audio and send </p>

                                <h3>Mobile Martus System Requirements</h3>
                                <ul class="list">
                                <li>Android device (e.g. phone or tablet) running 2.3.4 (Gingerbread) or later (Jellybean version 4.2 or later recommended)</li>
                                <li>If you want to retrieve your own records sent from Mobile Martus, you must also have the Martus Desktop Client installed (<a href="https//www/martus.org/download">download here</a>).  See Martus Desktop Account Setup” for more information.</li>
                                <li>If someone else is going to be receiving the records you send from Mobile Martus, they must have provided you with their Martus Desktop account Access Token and server information.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Martus Desktop Account Setup</h3>
                                <p>Anyone who is going to retrieve Mobile Martus records into a Martus Desktop account (whether it is you or someone else) must do the following steps.</p>
                                Please refer to <a href="#">Getting Started with Martus</a>.
                                <ol class=list>
                                <li>Create a Martus Desktop account that will retrieve records from Mobile Martus. </li>
                                <li>Configure a server in the Desktop Martus account. </li>
                                <li>Document the Martus Desktop account’s <a href="#">Access Token</a> in order to add the account as a Contact from the server. If you cannot connect to a server, you can also export the Martus Desktop account’s Public Information File (*.mpi) and copy to the mobile device (or give to you to copy to your mobile device).</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Note: If your Android device accepts SD cards, ideally transfer the Public Account File to an SD card and insert that SD card into your device.  Alternately you can email the file to an address that you can access on your Android device and download the attachment from there.</p>
                                <h3>Mobile Martus Setup</h3>
                                <ol class="list">
                                <li>Download the Mobile Martus app to your Android device from the Google Play Store.  If you can’t access the Google Play Store, please email <a href="mailto:martus@benetech.org">martus@benetech.org</a> for other ways to access the Mobile Martus app.</li>
                                <li>Install the app, which requires accepting the standard Android privacy statement. The Mobile Martus app will have permission to access the network (for sending records to the server) and storage (for saving account and encrypted record files) on your device.</li>
                                <li>The Martus app can be put on your home screen or found with your mobile device’s other applications.</li>

                                <li>Create a new password for Mobile Martus app use only. For security, make sure that this is different from any of your Martus Desktop account passwords.  Passwords must be at least 8 characters.</li>

                                <li>You have the option to turn on Tor before configuring your connection to a Martus server.  For more information on Tor, see <a href="#">Extra Security</a> below.

                                <li>Enter text as desired in the Title and Summary fields.  If your device has a voice recorder in its keyboard, you can speak the text you want to enter. </li>

                                <li>Click the Send button to send the record to the server. Text and attachments in the Martus record are encrypted and zipped before sending to the Martus server, and the zipped record files are removed from the mobile device once they are successfully sent to the server.</li>
                                <p>Note: The original attachments (e.g. photos in your Gallery) are not removed from the mobile device by Martus, so if you are worried about them being accessed by someone (e.g. if your device was stolen/lost), please remove them from your mobile device after you are notified that the record was sent successfully.  You may need to take extra precautions to ensure that the deleted original attachment files cannot still be accessed by an expert attacker.</p>

                                <li>If you are unable to send records due to internet or server connectivity issues, you can retry sending them later under your device’s menu button or menu icon (which looks like this on many devices:  ) by selecting <b>Manage Records</b> > <b>Resend Unsent Records</b>.  Martus will save the encrypted and zipped record files for you to re-send when you are in a location where you have connectivity.  If you receive messages saying that Martus could not send the records, you might want to check if you have <b>Use Wi-Fi Only</b> selected under your Martus <b>Settings</b>, and you can turn that setting off to use your mobile data plan if you want to send the Martus records right away.</li>

                                <p>Alternately, you can “Send to Martus” directly from most other applications on your mobile device, using the standard “Share” option (which looks like this on many devices  ). </p>

This will make it harder to track the route your record takes to the Martus server, and may allow you to reach the Martus server if it is blocked from your current location, but will also make sending records slower. Clicking on this will prompt you to first install, and then start up the Tor Orbot app if you haven’t done so already.</p>
