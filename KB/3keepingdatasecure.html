                                <div class="section-block">
                                    <p>A Martus account is secured with username, password and key. Your key is a .dat file saved on your computer in your Martus directory when you create an account. In order to access your account on another computer you will need a copy of your key. This is especially important if your laptop is stolen, confiscated or damaged. Benetech cannot recover your account so making sure you can access your data is up to the user. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>To ensure that you’ll always have access to your data, it is extremely important to keep a backup of your key. Martus offers two methods for backing up your key, either of which may be used, but we strongly recommend using both backup methods. The first method creates a single, password encrypted key backup file onto removable media (e.g. CD, USB storage) or a network drive; the second method backs up the key in three separate pieces (not encrypted with your password) onto multiple removable media.</p>

Do not write your password on the disk or store it on the disk electronically. No one can use the key you back up to a single file without your username and password. You MUST <b>back-up your key each time you change your password</b> since they are all associated.... or remember your old password.</p>

                                                <li>Insert a blank disk into your removable media drive.</li>
                                                <li>Choose <b>Account</b> > <b>Key Backup</b>.</li>

                                                <li>Name the file and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
                                                <p><b>Tip</b>: Give the file a unique name that you will remember later, and that can be distinguished from other accounts’ backup files. Each of the three files will have the same name, with a sequence number appended. For example, if you name the file kpbackup, the files will be saved as kpbackup-1.dat, kpbackup-2.dat, and so on.</p>
                                                <li>Navigate to your removable media drive in the Saving Backup Disk dialog box, and click Save. You must use a removable media drive (e.g. CD, USB storage) instead of your hard drive, because the program will not save two of your backup files to the same place.</li>
                                                <li>Insert removable media as prompted, clicking <b>OK</b> each time to proceed to the next disk.</li>

                                                <li>If Martus was able to verify the data on all the disks, click <b>OK</b> in the <i>Verification Succeeded</i> dialog box. If there were problems with one or more disks, repeat the backup process with different disks.</li>
                                                <li>Read the information in the Backup Complete dialog box, and click <b>OK</b>.</li>

                                    <p>If you have lost your computer, had a hard drive failure, or lost your key for some other reason, restore your key using your backup copy. If you know your username and password and have a single file key backup, we recommend you use that file as it is more secure. However if you have forgotten your password, you will need to restore your key from multiple disks. 
                                    </p>

                                    <li>Either use your old username and password or create a new username and password for your account.</li>
                                    <li>You will then be asked to create a password encrypted backup file of your key with this username and password. See "8a. Back up your key" for more details.</li>
                                    <li>After the restoration is complete, be sure to re-distribute the key backup disks. Any time two of those disks are in the same place, anyone could use them to access your account, even without knowing your username or password.<br><br>

                                <div class="section-block">
                                    <p>Martus automatically saves backup copies of saved, versioned and shared records to the Martus server as long as your configured server is set to On in the Martus main taskbar. This is one of the most important security features of Martus. Since your data is backed up to cloud servers you can recover your valuable data should your device (E.g. computer/laptop) be lost.</p>
                                    <p>All saved, shared and versioned records will be listed under the <i>Saved</i> label. When a record has been successfully sent to the server, a check mark appears in the <i>On Server</i> column though there may be a delay before the column is populated.</p>
                                    <p>If you do not have an Internet connection, or if your computer cannot connect to your designated server, the record remains unsent, and the <i>On Server</i> column will display an X. If you have not yet <a href="#">configured a server</a>, the Sent column will be blank. As soon as you connect to the Internet, and a valid Martus server is configured, Martus sends all waiting records to the server. Martus will alert you to any records waiting to be sent to the server when you end a session.</p>
                                    <p>Remember that backup can also happen without internet on external drives, by importing and exporting encrypted records as .mba files. We recommend backup be done regularly and off-site. (Contacts still must be configured in order for others to read it). Refer to the section on <a href="#">Using Martus without internet/limited access.</a></p>

                                <h2 class="section-title">Sharing and managing contacts</h2>
                                <div class="section-block">
                                    <p>Your colleagues — or anyone else you want to share your records, contacts or forms with (e.g. an editor who wants to review the work of a journalist, or even a colleague in your same office) — can create a Martus account and be added as one of your account’s Contacts, which will permit them to view your records only if you give them permission. They will not be able to create records using your account.</p>
                                    <h4>Configuring Contacts</h4>
                                    <p>a. To add a contact to your address book, navigate to Account  Manage Contacts</p>
                                    <p>b. To add a contact you need their account token. This is a 7 digit number that works like an email address. It identifies your contact and allows you to send to them. There are two ways to add a contact:</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left:25px;">i.  Add a Contact by pulling its Martus <i>Public Account ID</i> from the Martus server: Input the Contact’s <i>Martus Account Access Token</i> in the <i>Access Token</i> field and select <b>Add Contact…</b>; or</p>
                                    <p style="margin-left:25px;">ii. Add a Contact from a <i>Martus Public Information</i> (.mpi) file: Select <b>Import Contact from File…</b> and choose the (.mpi) file given to you by your Contact.</p>
                                    <p>c. Verify the Contact by reviewing the <i>Public Code</i> associated with the Contact’s <i>Access Token</i> and select <b>Verify Now</b>. If you select <b>Verify Later</b>, you can verify the Contact at another time by selecting <b>Verify Now</b> from the Verified column in the <i>Manage Contacts</i> window.</p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>Verification is important! For example, you receive an email from a colleague saying they have lost their account and need you to send all your sensitive data to a new account. If you verify their public code by phone or messenger your colleague might say no, that’s not me, I didn’t lose my account – don’t send anything! If it is them, they can confirm the number. </p>
                                     <p>d. Enter a <i>Contact Name</i> for the Contact. Use a label that is meaningful to you, as you may not always remember the account's public code. The Contact label might be the name of the person or organization, or the name of a city or region, for example. You can change the label later if you want to. Only you will see the label you assign; others who view the record will not see the label, for security reasons.</p>
                                     <p>e. Select <b>Save and Close</b>.</p>

                                     <h4>Share your account information with another Martus account</h4>
                                    <p><i>To share your Access Token and Public Code (used to add and verify you as a Contact):</i></p>
                                    <p>1.  Select <b>Account > Account Information</b>.</p>
                                    <p>2.  Give the <i>Access Token</i> to the Martus user who will add you as a Contact.</p>
                                    <p>3.  Communicate your Public Code through a secure communications channel in order to be verified once added as a Contact.</p>
                                    <p>4.  <b><i>Note:</i></b> Be sure to securely communicate access tokens and public codes using a method such as encrypted email, Off-the-record (OTR) chat, face to face, or another communication channel where nobody can intercept your information.</p>

                                    <p><i>To share your Martus Public Information (.mpi) file (used to add a Contact):</i></p>
                                    <p>1.  Select <b>Account > Account Information</b>.</p>
                                    <p>2.  Select <b>Export My Public Account ID</b>, and name the file. Martus saves the file with a .mpi extension in your account directory in the Martus folder on your hard drive by default (though you can also save it elsewhere on your computer if desired), and confirms that it has been saved.</p>
                                    <p>3.  Give the .mpi file to the Martus account holder who wants to add you as a Contact. If you can’t find your .mpi file on a Mac, see “10. Frequently Asked Questions.”</p>

                                    <h4>Share records with your Contacts</h4>
                                    <p><i>To share a record individually with a Contact:</i></p>
                                    <p>1.  Choose to <b>Create</b> or <b>Edit</b> a record and input any data.</p>
                                    <p>2.  Select the <b>Add Contacts</b> icon.</p>
                                    <p>3.  Select the box(es) next to the Contact(s) with whom you would like to share the record</p>
                                    <p>4.  Select <b>OK</b>.</p>
                                    <p>5.  Select <b>Share</b> to save the record.</p>

                                    <p><i>To share all new records with a Contact by default:</i></p>
                                    <p>1.  Select <b>Account > Manage Contacts</b>.</p>
                                    <p>2.  Select the <b>Manage Contacts</b> button.</p>
                                    <p>3.  Check the <i>Send to by Default</i> box for the desired Contact. 
                                    <b><i>Note:</i></b> You can still deny access to individual records as you create them.</p>

                                    <p>Contacts will continue to have access to any records or record versions you saved while permission was given to their accounts. However, they will not have permission to view any future records or new record versions you save once you deny them access.</p>
                                    <p><i>To deny access to individual records:</i></p>
                                    <p>1.  Select the record that you would like to update and select Edit.</p>
                                    <p>2.  Select the Add Contact.</p>
                                    <p>3.  Uncheck any Contacts that you would no longer like to share the record with.</p>
                                    <p>4.  Save, Version or Share the record.</p>
                                    <p><i>To remove a Contact (prevents access to all new records or new record versions)):</i></p>
                                    <p>1.  Select Account > Manage Contacts.</p>
                                    <p>2.  Select the Manage Contacts button.</p>
                                    <p>3.  Select the X in the Remove column for the Contact you wish to remove.</p>
                                    <p>4.  Select Yes to confirm removal in the Remove Contact dialog box.</p>
                                    <p>5.  Select Save and Close.</p>
                                    <p>As soon as a record has been shared with a Contact, the information in that record will be available to that Contact. Removing that Contact later will not prevent that Contact from viewing the data that was saved when they were configured as your Contact, but it will prevent them from viewing any the data in any records (or new versions of records) you create after they were removed.</p>
